; Close running instances before install/update.
; The filter decides which of the files we are about to replace get registered
; with RestartManager, and therefore which locks are detected. Listing only the
; main exe left every DLL in _internal unwatched: a foreign process holding one
; of them (measured: Claude Desktop's Chrome native host had VCRUNTIME140.dll
; loaded) was never closed, the copy failed, and the rollback left the app
; unable to start, since [InstallDelete] had already removed the old _internal.

[InstallDelete]
; Clean previous installation to avoid stale files. This runs BEFORE the new
; files are copied, so a failure here is not "the update did not happen" but
; "the app is gone": the rollback removes what was copied and cannot bring back
; what this deleted. It stays because a PyInstaller folder with leftovers from
; another Python version fails in stranger ways, but it is the reason the
; CloseApplicationsFilter above has to cover every file we replace.

[Run]
; Relaunch the widget FIRST so its cold start overlaps with everything else.
; "postinstall" was adding a check box on the Finished wizard page, which
; simply doesn't exist under /VERYSILENT (our auto-update flow), so the widget
; never came back up. Dropping the flag runs the exe in every mode.
; runasoriginaluser: the setup runs elevated, but the widget must relaunch as
; the logged-in (non-elevated) user. Without it the process inherits the admin
; token; on machines where the standard user is not the elevating admin, the
; widget would read/write config under the admin profile's LocalAppData and the
; user's own settings would appear to vanish on the next normal start.
; The relaunch races the antivirus, which still holds the files we have just
; written: the widget then dies at import with "DLL load failed while
; importing _ssl", and starting it by hand a moment later works with the files
; intact. Measured twice on this machine.
; Reading the module that fails first pushes that scan to complete here.

; And it is started a second time a few seconds later, which is what actually
; recovers the case where the first one lost the race: a widget that is
; already up makes the second launch a no-op, since a second instance finds
; the single-instance mutex taken, raises the running window and exits.
